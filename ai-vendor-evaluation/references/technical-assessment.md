## Assessment Areas

### 1. Core AI Technology

- Clear testing methodology
- Concrete performance metrics
- Understanding of limitations

**Red flags**:
- Vague about technology ("proprietary AI")
- Unrealistic accuracy claims
- No performance metrics
- Can't explain how it works

---

### 2. Data Handling

**Questions to ask**:
- What data do you need from us?
- How is data processed and stored?
- What happens to our data?
- Do you use our data to train models?

**What to look for**:
- Clear data requirements
- Secure data handling (encryption, access controls)
- Transparent data usage
- Data deletion guarantees

**Red flags**:
- Unclear data requirements
- Insecure data handling
- Use customer data without permission
- Data retained indefinitely

---

### 3. Integration Architecture

**Questions to ask**:
- What APIs do you provide?
- What integrations do you support?
- What's the integration process?
- What technical resources are needed?

**What to look for**:
- RESTful APIs or standard protocols
- Good API documentation
- Common integration patterns (webhooks, SDKs)
- Reasonable integration timeline

**Red flags**:
- No APIs or proprietary protocols
- Poor or missing documentation
- Complex custom integration required
- Unrealistic integration timeline

---

### 4. Scalability

**Questions to ask**:
- What's your capacity (requests/sec, data volume)?
- How do you handle traffic spikes?
- What's your typical latency?
- Do you have auto-scaling?

**What to look for**:
- Clear capacity numbers
- Proven at scale
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Low, consistent latency

**Red flags**:
- Vague about capacity
- No auto-scaling
- High or variable latency
- Haven't proven at scale

---

### 5. Security

**Questions to ask**:
- What security certifications do you have?
- How do you protect customer data?
- What's your security incident history?
- Can we conduct security audit?

**What to look for**:
- SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Transparent about incidents

**Red flags**:
- No security certifications
- Unclear security practices
- Won't allow audits
- Hidden security incidents

---

### 6. Reliability

**Questions to ask**:
- What's your uptime SLA?
- What's your actual uptime?
- How do you handle failures?
- What's your incident response process?

**What to look for**:
- 99.9%+ uptime SLA
- Actual uptime meets or exceeds SLA
- Clear incident response
- Graceful degradation

**Red flags**:
- No SLA or "best effort"
- Frequent outages
- Poor incident response
- No redundancy

## Technical Deep Dive Questions

### Model Performance
1. What's your model accuracy on [specific task]?
2. How do you measure accuracy?
3. What's the confidence interval?
4. How does performance degrade on edge cases?
5. How do you handle model drift?

### Data Processing
1. What data format do you accept?
2. How much data is needed for training/tuning?
3. How do you handle missing or malformed data?
4. What preprocessing do you do?
5. Can we inspect data processing?

### API & Integration
1. What's your API rate limit?
2. What's the request/response format?
3. How do you handle errors?
4. What monitoring/logging is available?
5. Can we test API before committing?

### Infrastructure
1. What cloud provider do you use?
2. Where are data centers located?
3. What's your disaster recovery plan?
4. How do you handle updates/maintenance?
5. What's your deployment process?

- <3.0: Significant technical risk

---

## Technical Red Flags

🔴 **Disqualifying**:
- No security certifications
- Can't explain core technology
- No API or documentation
- Significant security incidents

🚩 **Serious concerns**:
- Vague about technical details
- Poor scalability
- Unclear data handling
- Limited integration options

⚠️ **Monitor**:
- Newer technology stack
- Limited proven scale
- Some technical debt
- Integration complexity

---

## Technical Validation Steps

### Step 1: Review Documentation
- API documentation quality
- Technical architecture overview
- Security documentation
- Integration guides

### Step 2: Technical Demo
- Request live technical demo
- Test with your actual data
- Observe performance
- Note any issues

### Step 3: API Testing
- Test API calls
- Check response times
- Verify error handling
- Review logging/monitoring

### Step 4: Security Review

- Request security documentation
- Conduct security assessment
- Verify compliance

### Step 5: Reference Checks
- Speak with technical contacts at reference customers
- Ask about technical issues
- Understand integration complexity
- Learn about ongoing technical challenges

## Decision Criteria

**Proceed if**:
- Technical score ≥ 4.0
- No disqualifying red flags
- Security requirements met
- Integration feasible

**Proceed with caution if**:
- Technical score 3.0-3.9
- Some concerns but addressable
- Mitigation plan in place

**Do not proceed if**:

## Summary

**Key technical evaluation points**:
1. Understand core technology
2. Verify security and compliance
3. Test integration feasibility
4. Confirm scalability and performance
5. Validate with technical references

**Remember**: Technical capabilities are foundational. Even if business terms are good, poor technical fit leads to project failure.
