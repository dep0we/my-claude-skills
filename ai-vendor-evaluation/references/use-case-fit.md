# Use Case Fit Assessment

Framework for determining whether a vendor solution actually fits your specific use case.

---

## Assessment Framework

### 1. Define Your Use Case Clearly

**Core questions**:
- What problem are you solving?
- Who are the users?
- What's the success criteria?
- What are the constraints?
- What volume/scale is required?

**Be specific**: "Classify customer support tickets" not "AI for customer service"

---

### 2. Vendor Capability Match

**Assess**:
- Has vendor solved this exact problem before?
- Do they have customers with similar use cases?
- What's their track record in your domain?
- Can they provide relevant case studies?

**Scoring**:
- ‚úÖ **Exact match**: Multiple customers, proven results
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Close match**: Similar use cases, some adaptation needed
- ‚ùå **Poor match**: Different domain, unproven for your needs

---

### 3. Domain Expertise

**Questions for vendor**:
- How many customers in [your industry]?
- What industry-specific challenges have you solved?
- Do you understand [domain-specific terminology]?
- What domain expertise is on your team?

**Red flags**:
- No customers in your industry
- Generic solution claiming to work everywhere
- Doesn't understand domain nuances
- No domain experts on team

---

### 4. Data Requirements

**Assess compatibility**:
- What data do they need?
- Do you have that data available?
- What format/quality is required?
- How much data is needed?

**Common mismatches**:
- Vendor needs structured data, you have unstructured
- Requires large training set, you have small dataset
- Needs labeled data, you have unlabeled
- Different data format than you provide

---

### 5. Integration Requirements

**Evaluate**:
- Do they integrate with your existing systems?
- What APIs/webhooks do they support?
- Can they work with your tech stack?
- What's the integration complexity?

**Warning signs**:
- Requires replacing existing systems
- No integration with your tools
- Complex custom integration needed
- Incompatible tech stack

---

### 6. Scale and Performance

**Match your needs**:
- Can they handle your volume?
- What's their latency?
- How do they handle spikes?
- Can they grow with you?

**Mismatches to avoid**:
- Your volume exceeds their capacity
- Latency too slow for your use case
- Can't handle your traffic patterns
- Won't scale to future needs

## Fit Assessment Scorecard

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Use case match | | 30% | |
| Domain expertise | | 20% | |
| Data compatibility | | 20% | |
| Integration fit | | 15% | |
| Scale/performance | | 15% | |
| **Total** | | 100% | |

**Interpretation**:
- 4.0+: Excellent fit, proceed confidently
- 3.0-3.9: Reasonable fit, manageable gaps
- <3.0: Poor fit, high risk of failure

## Questions to Ask Yourself

**Before evaluation**:
1. Have I clearly defined the use case?
2. What are my success criteria?
3. What are my constraints?
4. What's my ideal solution?

**During evaluation**:
1. Have they solved this exact problem?
2. Can they show proof?
3. What gaps exist?
4. Are gaps addressable?

**Before decision**:
1. Am I confident they can deliver?
2. What's the risk of failure?
3. What's my backup plan?
4. Have I seen this working?

---

## Questions to Ask Vendor

**About experience**:
- "Show me 3 customers with similar use cases"
- "What results did they achieve?"
- "What challenges did they face?"
- "How is my use case different?"

**About capabilities**:
- "Walk me through how this would work for my specific use case"
- "What data do you need from me?"
- "What's the expected accuracy/performance?"
- "What are the limitations?"

**About proof**:
- "Can we do a pilot with my actual data?"
- "What's your success rate for similar use cases?"
- "Can I speak with similar customers?"
- "What happens if it doesn't work?"

## Common Use Case Mismatches

### Mismatch 1: Generic Solution for Specific Need
**Problem**: Vendor has generic tool, your need is highly specific  
**Example**: Generic text classifier vs industry-specific medical coding  
**Risk**: Won't work well, requires extensive customization

### Mismatch 2: Simple Solution for Complex Problem
**Problem**: Vendor built for simpler use case  
**Example**: Basic chatbot vs complex multi-turn dialogue  
**Risk**: Will hit limitations quickly

### Mismatch 3: Different Domain
**Problem**: Vendor from different industry  
**Example**: Retail vendor for healthcare use case  
**Risk**: Misses domain nuances, compliance issues

### Mismatch 4: Scale Mismatch
**Problem**: Built for different scale  
**Example**: SMB tool for enterprise deployment  
**Risk**: Performance issues, can't handle volume

### Mismatch 5: Data Type Mismatch
**Problem**: Optimized for different data  
**Example**: Text model for audio/video  
**Risk**: Poor accuracy, doesn't work as expected

## Red Flags for Poor Fit

üö© "We can customize it for you" (expensive, risky)  
üö© "No one's done exactly this before" (you're the guinea pig)  
üö© "It should work for your use case" (not confident)  
üö© "Just need to do some customization" (scope creep)  
üö© "All our customers are different" (no proven pattern)  
üö© Won't commit to specific outcomes  
üö© Can't show similar customer success  

---

## Pilot Testing

**Before full commitment, pilot test**:

**Pilot structure**:
1. Define success criteria upfront
2. Test with real data (not cherry-picked examples)
3. Involve actual users
4. Set timeline (4-8 weeks typical)
5. Measure against criteria

**Pilot success criteria**:
- Accuracy/quality meets minimum threshold
- Performance acceptable
- Users can actually use it
- Integration works
- Costs align with expectations

**Pilot failure = Do not proceed**

## Decision Framework

```
Is use case match score ‚â• 4.0?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Proceed to deep evaluation
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue below

Is use case match score ‚â• 3.0 AND gaps addressable?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Require pilot before commitment
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Do not proceed

Are there alternative vendors with better fit?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Evaluate alternatives
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Consider build vs buy
```

## Summary Checklist

Before selecting vendor, confirm:

- [ ] Vendor has solved this exact use case before
- [ ] Multiple customers with similar use case
- [ ] Vendor understands domain requirements
- [ ] Data compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Integration feasibility verified
- [ ] Scale/performance adequate
- [ ] Success criteria agreed upon
- [ ] Pilot completed successfully (if needed)

**If you can't check most boxes, fit is poor. Find better vendor or build.**
