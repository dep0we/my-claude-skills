## How to Use This Guide

**Severity levels:**
- üö© **Red flag** - Serious concern, investigate deeply before proceeding
- üî¥ **Disqualifying** - Do not proceed without resolution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow flag** - Notable concern, needs clarification

**Decision rule**: Multiple red flags in same category = disqualifying. Any single disqualifying flag = stop evaluation.

---

## Technical Red Flags

### üî¥ Vague About Core Technology
**Symptoms:**
- Won't explain how their AI actually works
- Claims "proprietary AI" but can't describe approach
- Defensive when asked technical questions
- No technical documentation available

**Why it matters**: If they can't explain their technology, either it doesn't exist or they're hiding something.

**What to do**: Press for technical details. If still vague, disqualify.

---

### üî¥ Impossible Claims
**Examples:**
- "100% accuracy on all tasks"
- "Our AI understands context perfectly"
- "Never makes mistakes"
- "Works on any use case without training"

**Why it matters**: AI is probabilistic. Anyone claiming perfection is lying or ignorant.

**What to do**: Ask for accuracy metrics with confidence intervals. If they can't provide or claims remain impossible, disqualify.

---

### üö© No Performance Metrics
**Symptoms:**
- Can't provide accuracy numbers
- Vague about performance ("very accurate")
- No benchmarks or evaluations
- Unwilling to test on your data

**Why it matters**: You can't manage what you don't measure. No metrics = no accountability.

**What to do**: Request performance evaluation on your data before commitment.

---

### üö© Black Box System
**Symptoms:**
- No visibility into how decisions are made
- Can't explain outputs

## Using This Guide

**During initial call/demo:**
- Note all red flags observed
- Ask direct questions about concerning areas
- Give vendor chance to address flags

**Before deep evaluation:**
- Review red flag count
- Disqualify vendors with multiple flags in single category
- Document remaining flags for due diligence
